        <p class="reviews__text">Not gonna lie, I wish I was able to eat breakfast there regularly. It is that good. It is super cozy and the vibe is modern yet nostalgic? Anyway, the apple butter is amazing! And the grits.... THE GRITS...</p>

        <p class="reviews__text">Tasty and quick! Just the way I like it. I ordered over easy eggs, grits, a biscuit and a pancake. The grits were nice and creamy and the chicken sausage patties were yummy! I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.</p>

        <p class="reviews__text">Always LOVE eating at Flying Biscuit Cafe. Midtown location is a great community eatery. You can feel the vibe as people walk by enjoying life. The service was great.</p>

        <p class="reviews__text">The creamy grits and biscuits with apple butter are incredible. I also had the peaches and cream Belgian waffle that was super fluffy and soft and crunchy in all the right places. Everything was delicious.</p>

        <p class="reviews__text">WOW… I am not one to normally review a place but here I am. I got the Flying Biscuit Breakfast and there was not a single thing I didn't like. I could eat those biscuits every day for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy.</p>
